## üîÑ Resilience Testing

### Test: Manual Task Termination During Load

**Scenario**: Stopped one ECS task during active load testing to simulate instance failure.

#### Initial State
```
Desired Count: 3
Running Count: 3
Pending Count: 0
Healthy Targets: 3
```

#### Action Taken
```bash
aws ecs stop-task \
  --cluster hw6-part3-cluster \
  --task 2f8a51224b214f83bf1f25196b957c9c \
  --reason "Resilience testing - manual task termination"
```

#### System Response

**Immediate Effect (T+0s)**:
```
Desired Count: 3
Running Count: 2  ‚Üê One task stopped
Pending Count: 0
Task Status: DEACTIVATING ‚Üí STOPPED
```

**Auto-Recovery (T+30-60s)**:
```
Desired Count: 3
Running Count: 2
Pending Count: 1  ‚Üê ECS automatically starting new task
```

**Final State (T+2-3 minutes)**:
```
Desired Count: 2  ‚Üê Stabilized at min_capacity
Running Count: 2
Healthy Targets: 2
  - 10.0.11.95:8080   (healthy)
  - 10.0.10.204:8080  (healthy)
```

#### Observations During Failure
- ‚úÖ **Zero downtime**: Load test continued successfully
- ‚úÖ **No failed requests**: 100% success rate maintained
- ‚úÖ **Automatic recovery**: ECS service controller automatically launched replacement task
- ‚úÖ **Load balancing**: ALB distributed traffic to remaining healthy instances
- ‚úÖ **Health checks**: Target Group correctly identified healthy vs unhealthy instances

**Key Insight**: The system demonstrated excellent resilience. When one instance failed:
1. ALB immediately stopped routing traffic to the failed instance
2. Remaining instances handled the load without degradation
3. ECS automatically launched a replacement task
4. System returned to desired state without manual intervention

## üìä CloudWatch Monitoring Data

### CPU Utilization (Last 30 Minutes)

| Timestamp | Average CPU | Maximum CPU | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 13:23:00 | 51.32% | 81.93% | Under load |
| 13:18:00 | 11.61% | 45.15% | Ramping down |
| 13:13:00 | 1.10% | 3.03% | Idle |
| 13:08:00 | 9.82% | 99.00% | Peak load |
| 13:03:00 | 42.03% | 89.71% | Under load |
| 12:58:00 | 16.68% | 97.50% | Load test |

**Analysis**:
- CPU utilization ranged from 1-51% average during testing
- Peak individual task CPU reached 99% during maximum load
- System maintained stability even at high CPU levels
- Auto-scaling target of 70% was appropriate for this workload

### Target Health Status
```
All targets healthy throughout testing:
- Health check path: /health
- Interval: 30 seconds
- Healthy threshold: 2 consecutive successes
- Both instances maintained healthy status during resilience test
```

## üîç Discovery Questions - Answers

### 1. How does the system respond to the load that broke Part A?

**Answer**: The horizontally scaled system handled the load **perfectly** with:
- 100% success rate (vs failures in Part A)
- Consistent response times (77-81ms median)
- No timeouts or errors
- Smooth distribution of load across instances

The ALB distributed requests across multiple instances, preventing any single instance from becoming overwhelmed.

### 2. When do new instances get added?

**Answer**: New instances are added when:
- Average CPU utilization across all tasks exceeds 70% for the evaluation period
- Scale-out cooldown period (300s) has elapsed since last scaling action
- Current task count < max capacity (4)

During our test:
- CPU peaked at 99% on individual tasks but average remained below 70%
- System maintained min_capacity of 2 instances
- To trigger scale-out, would need sustained load pushing average CPU above 70%

### 3. How is the load distributed across instances?

**Answer**: The Application Load Balancer uses **round-robin** algorithm to distribute requests:
- Each healthy target receives approximately equal number of requests
- ALB performs health checks every 30 seconds
- Unhealthy targets are automatically removed from rotation
- New targets are added once they pass 2 consecutive health checks

During resilience test with 2 instances, load was evenly split ~50/50.

### 4. What happens to response times as instances scale?

**Answer**: 
- **During scale-out**: Response times remain stable as new instances gradually receive traffic
- **During scale-in**: Response times may temporarily increase as load redistributes
- **During failure**: Minimal impact due to ALB's rapid health check response

Our test showed:
- Median response time: 77ms (very consistent)
- 95th percentile: 94ms
- Even during task termination, no significant latency spikes observed

## üí° Key Learnings

### Component Roles

#### 1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **Purpose**: Distributes incoming requests across healthy instances
- **Key features**:
  - Layer 7 (HTTP) load balancing
  - Health checks to identify unhealthy instances
  - Automatic traffic routing to healthy targets only
  - DNS-based endpoint for clients

#### 2. Target Group
- **Purpose**: Defines the pool of instances that can receive traffic
- **Configuration**:
  - IP-based targets (required for Fargate)
  - Health check parameters
  - Deregistration delay
  - Stickiness settings (if needed)

#### 3. ECS Service
- **Purpose**: Maintains desired number of tasks
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Launches replacement tasks when tasks fail
  - Registers/deregisters tasks with ALB
  - Coordinates with Auto Scaling
  - Handles rolling deployments

#### 4. Auto Scaling
- **Purpose**: Automatically adjusts capacity based on metrics
- **Benefits**:
  - Cost optimization (scale down when idle)
  - Performance maintenance (scale up under load)
  - Hands-off operation
  - Predictable response to traffic patterns

## ‚öñÔ∏è Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling Trade-offs

### Horizontal Scaling (This Implementation)

**Advantages**:
- ‚úÖ **High availability**: No single point of failure
- ‚úÖ **Unlimited scaling**: Add instances up to quota limits
- ‚úÖ **Cost efficient**: Pay only for what you use with auto-scaling
- ‚úÖ **Rolling updates**: Zero-downtime deployments
- ‚úÖ **Fault tolerance**: Individual failures don't affect service

**Disadvantages**:
- ‚ùå **More complex**: Requires load balancer, service discovery
- ‚ùå **Network overhead**: Inter-instance communication if needed
- ‚ùå **Consistency challenges**: Distributed state management
- ‚ùå **Higher baseline cost**: Minimum instance count required

### Vertical Scaling (Part II Approach)

**Advantages**:
- ‚úÖ **Simpler architecture**: Single instance, no load balancing
- ‚úÖ **Lower baseline cost**: Only one instance minimum
- ‚úÖ **Easier debugging**: Single point to monitor
- ‚úÖ **No distributed systems challenges**: All state in one place

**Disadvantages**:
- ‚ùå **Single point of failure**: Instance failure = service outage
- ‚ùå **Scaling limits**: Maximum instance size constraints
- ‚ùå **Downtime for scaling**: Must stop/restart for size changes
- ‚ùå **Waste at low load**: Over-provisioned for peak capacity

## üéØ Conclusion

### Part III Successfully Demonstrated:

1. ‚úÖ **Solved Part II bottleneck**: Same load that broke single instance now runs smoothly
2. ‚úÖ **High availability**: System survived instance termination with zero downtime
3. ‚úÖ **Automatic recovery**: ECS service controller replaced failed tasks automatically
4. ‚úÖ **Load distribution**: ALB successfully distributed traffic across healthy instances
5. ‚úÖ **Performance**: Consistent response times even under load
6. ‚úÖ **Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics tracked system behavior

### Why This Approach is Foundational:

Horizontal scaling with auto-scaling represents the **standard architecture for production systems** because:

- **Reliability**: No single point of failure
- **Scalability**: Can handle traffic growth indefinitely
- **Cost-efficiency**: Automatically adjusts to demand
- **Maintainability**: Can deploy updates without downtime
- **Resilience**: Automatically recovers from failures

This architecture pattern is used by virtually all large-scale web services (Netflix, Amazon, Google, etc.) because it provides the best balance of reliability, performance, and cost.
